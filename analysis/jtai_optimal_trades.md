## Key Takeaways

1. **Both trades exited 4+ hours too early** - Lost 57-84% potential gain
2. **Trailing stop fixes will help** - But need to test on next volatile stock
3. **Daily loss limit prevented re-entry** - Missed 26% gain opportunity
4. **Re-entry logic needed** - Should allow re-entry if pattern still valid
5. **Partial profit strategy optimal** - Locks in profits while letting winners run

## Recommended Strategy Going Forward

1. **Entry**: Use strong setup confirmation (85%+ confidence)
2. **Initial Stop**: ATR-based stop loss (already implemented)
3. **Trailing Stop**: Only after 3% profit (already fixed)
4. **Partial Exit**: Take 50% at +5% profit
5. **Final Exit**: ATR-based trailing stop (2x ATR) or trend reversal
6. **Re-Entry**: Allow re-entry if pattern still valid after stop loss
7. **Daily Limits**: Use per-ticker limits instead of global limit

## Implementation Status

✅ **Fixed**: Trailing stop activation threshold (requires 3% profit)
✅ **Fixed**: Trailing stop never goes below entry price
✅ **Fixed**: ATR-based trailing stops for volatile stocks
✅ **Fixed**: Trailing stop only moves up, never down
⏳ **Pending**: Daily loss limit improvements (per-ticker or time-based)
⏳ **Pending**: Re-entry logic after stop loss
⏳ **Pending**: Volatility-based stop adjustments

## Lessons Learned

1. **Volatile stocks need wider stops** - 2.5% is too tight
2. **Daily loss limits can prevent opportunities** - Need smarter limits
3. **Re-entry is important** - Don't give up after one stop loss
4. **Partial profits protect gains** - Let winners run with protection
5. **ATR-based stops adapt better** - Fixed percentages don't work for all stocks
