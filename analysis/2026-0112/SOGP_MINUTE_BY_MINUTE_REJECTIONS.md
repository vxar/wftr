## Root Cause Summary

### Critical Issue at Actual Entry Time (09:06:20)

**At 09:06:20 (actual entry time)**:
- **Price**: $13.65 ✅ (matches actual entry)
- **60-minute Volume**: 32,626 shares
- **Rejection Reason**: ❌ **Low volume stock (total 32,626 < 500,000 over 60 min)**

**Analysis**:
- The bot requires 500K shares traded over 60 minutes
- At 09:06, only 32,626 shares have been traded in the last 60 minutes
- This is **15x below** the required threshold
- The stock is just starting to move, but hasn't accumulated enough volume yet

### Rejection Reason Distribution

| Rejection Reason | Count | Percentage |
|------------------|-------|------------|
| Low volume stock (< 500K over 60 min) | 33 | 55% |
| Not in longer-term uptrend (-8.3% < 2%) | 17 | 28% |
| No pattern detected | 6 | 10% |
| MAs not in bullish order | 3 | 5% |
| Confidence too low (< 72%) | 2 | 3% |
| **Total** | **60** | **100%** |

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Volume Requirement (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: 500K volume requirement blocks early morning entries
- At 09:06, volume is only 32,626 (15x below threshold)
- Stock is starting to move but hasn't accumulated 500K yet

**Solution**:
1. **Time-based volume threshold**: Use lower threshold (200K) for first hour of trading (9-10 AM)
2. **Progressive threshold**: Start at 200K at 9 AM, increase to 500K by 10 AM
3. **Fast mover override**: If volume ratio > 3x AND momentum > 3%, use 200K threshold

### Priority 2: Relax Uptrend Requirement
**Problem**: -8.3% over 15 periods blocks entries even when stock is moving up
- Stock may be starting a new trend from lower base
- Recent momentum (last 5-10 periods) is more relevant

**Solution**:
1. For fast movers: Allow -5% to +2% range (can be starting new trend)
2. Focus on recent momentum (5-10 periods) instead of 15-period lookback
3. If recent momentum is positive, relax the 15-period requirement

### Priority 3: Relax MA Order Requirement
**Problem**: Perfect MA order (SMA5 > SMA10 > SMA20) is too strict
- Fast-moving stocks may not have perfect alignment initially

**Solution**:
1. For fast movers: Allow entry if price is above key MAs (SMA10, SMA20) even if not in perfect order
2. Check if price is trending up (higher highs) instead of perfect MA order

## Implementation Priority

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix volume requirement for early morning (9-10 AM) - use 200K threshold
2. **HIGH**: Relax uptrend requirement for fast movers - allow -5% to +2% range
3. **MEDIUM**: Relax MA order requirement for fast movers - allow if price above key MAs
